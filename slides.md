# When Jesus said, “I have come not to abolish but to fulfill,” what did he mean?

<!--
* In order to answer this question, we need to understand the role of the law in the larger story of Israel.
* Today we'll be going over a few key texts that describe this.

# What did Israel agree to at Sinai?

# What does this mean for the nation's destiny?

# Exodus 19:17--20:19 (NRSV)
## “Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God\.\.\.\. Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had descended upon it in fire; the smoke went up like the smoke of a kiln, while the whole mountain shook violently\.\.\.\. When the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> descended upon Mount Sinai... the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. Then the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to Moses, ‘Go down and warn the people not to break through to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to look; otherwise many of them will perish\.\.\.\.’ Then God spoke all these words: I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God\.\.\.\. \[The people\] were afraid and trembled and stood at a distance, and said to Moses, ‘You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die.’”

* The entire scene is theophanic, i.e., God is revealing himself to Israel. God's presence is the defining factor throughout.
* This theophanic event is the context for the delivery of the ten commandments. There's been a few different suggestions regarding the actual audience of the ten commandments, i.e., can the entire encampment of Israel hear God's words?
    * For some (and I agree), the answer is *yes*: Carol Meyers calls this "the most direct appearance of God to an entire people in the Hebrew Bible" (*Exodus*, 155).
    * Additionally, the ten commandments are *God's direct speech to Israel*, unmediated by Moses.
    * The experience of receiving the commandments proves too much for Israel, so Moses is the mediator of the rest of the Sinai laws, i.e., the book of the covenant.
* Another observation that should be made about the content of the commandments is that they aren't really laws *per se*, since they lack any consistent enforcement mechanism or casuistic explanation, i.e., *if this happens, then do this*.
* These ten commandments function, then, not as a formal legal code in their own right, but as perspective-shaping principles for Israel as the nation that covenants with and serves God.

# The Book of the Covenant 
## [Exodus 20:18--23:33](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+20/)

<!--
* The ten commandments are followed by a collection of laws that is commonly referred to as the "Book of the Covenant".
* These laws are mediated through Moses, who delivers them to the people of Israel.
* Unlike the ten commandments, these laws are referred to as "ordinances" (mishpatim).
* The ordinances cover a wide range of topics, but they are almost all connected to the ten commandments in some way.
    * These are the "implementation details" of the ten commandments.
    * Unlike the commandments, some of these ordinances include enforcement mechanisms and casuistic explanations.
    * Some ordinances cover what we might refer to "ritual" or "ceremonial" topics, once again suggesting that the tripartite division of the law is foreign to the Hebrew Bible.

# Exodus 24:1--12 (NRSV)
## “Then he said to Moses, ‘Come up to the <sc>Lord</sc>, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship at a distance. Moses alone shall come near the <sc>Lord</sc>\.\.\.\. Moses came and told the people all the words of the <sc>Lord</sc> and <span v-mark="{ color: '#f72f47', type: 'underline', strokeWidth: 3, at: 1 }">all the ordinances</span>; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, ‘<span v-mark="{ color: '#f72f47', type: 'underline', strokeWidth: 3, at: 1 }">All the words</span> that the <sc>Lord</sc> has spoken we will do.’ And Moses wrote down <span v-mark="{ color: '#f72f47', type: 'underline', strokeWidth: 3, at: 1 }">all the words</span> of the <sc>Lord</sc>. He rose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and set up twelve pillars, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel. He sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed oxen as offerings of well-being to the <sc>Lord</sc>. Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he dashed against the altar. Then he took <span v-mark="{ color: '#3d8ee0', type: 'underline', strokeWidth: 3, at: 2 }">the book of the covenant</span>, and read it in the hearing of the people; and they said, ‘<span v-mark="{ color: '#3d8ee0', type: 'underline', strokeWidth: 3, at: 2 }">All</span> that the <sc>Lord</sc> has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.’ Moses took the blood and dashed it on the people, and said, ‘See the blood of the covenant that the <sc>Lord</sc> has made with you in accordance with <span v-mark="{ color: '#3d8ee0', type: 'underline', strokeWidth: 3, at: 2 }">all these words</span>.’ Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there was something like a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness. God did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; also they beheld God, and they ate and drank.”

<!--
* The entire Sinai event culminates in the ratification of the covenant.
* This involves the reading of **all** the commandments and ordinances, and explicitly the **book of the covenant**.
* This is a two phase process. The blood of the sacrifice is not applied to the people until the covenantal material is read in its entirety.
    * It is, after all, the "blood of the covenant **in accordance with all these words**."

# Exodus 25:1--31:18: God's presence is regulated
### 31:18: “When God finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.”

<!--
* This section describes the construction of the tabernacle and the priests who attend to it.
* God's presence among Israel as their God is regulated by the tabernacle and the service of the priests.
    * The danger that the divine presence presents to an imperfect nation is made safe by the buffer that the tabernacle and priests provide.
* Once the covenantal terms have been agreed to, the terms of God's presence can be defined.

# Leviticus 1:1 (NRSV)
“The <sc>Lord</sc> summoned Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying: Speak to the people of Israel and say to them...”

# Leviticus 27:34 (NRSV)
“These are the commandments that the <sc>Lord</sc> gave to Moses for the people of Israel on Mount Sinai.”

<!--
* The entirety of Leviticus is not described as something separate from Sinai.
* To say it another way, the set of regulations described in Leviticus is portrayed as a part of the *mishpatim*/ordinances that were delivered to Israel through Moses at Sinai.
* We don't have the law of Sinai and then the law of Leviticus, but rather an entire body of covenantal law that holistically binds Israel to God.

# What about _the greatest commandment_?

---
layout: quote
---

# Deuteronomy 6:1--9 (NRSV)
“Now this is the commandment—the statutes and the ordinances—that the <sc>Lord</sc> your God charged me to teach you to observe in the land that you are about to cross into and occupy, so that you and your children and your children’s children may fear the <sc>Lord</sc> your God all the days of your life, and keep all his decrees and his commandments that I am commanding you, so that your days may be long. Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe them diligently, so that it may go well with you, and so that you may multiply greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, as the <sc>Lord</sc>, the God of your ancestors, has promised you. 

_Hear, O Israel: The <sc>Lord</sc> our God, the <sc>Lord</sc> is one_. You shall love the <sc>Lord</sc> your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. Keep these words that I am commanding you today in your heart. Recite them to your children and talk about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise. Bind them as a sign on your hand, fix them as an emblem on your forehead, and write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. 

<!--
* Notably, Deuteronomy and the reading of the law at Moab are not a _second law_.
* Moses narrates the history of the people and brings Israel back to Sinai through that narration.
* It is as if the people are receiving the law again afresh.
* The so-called _great commandment_ isn't something apart from the law of Sinai, but rather a summary of the law and the ordinances that the nation received at Sinai.

# Deuteronomy 28:58--68 (NRSV)
“If you do not diligently observe all the words of this law that are written in this book, fearing this glorious and awesome name, the <sc>Lord</sc> your God, then the <sc>Lord</sc> will overwhelm both you and your offspring with severe and lasting afflictions and grievous and lasting maladies. He will bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt, of which you were in dread, and they shall cling to you. Every other malady and affliction, even though not recorded in the book of this law, the <sc>Lord</sc> will inflict on you until you are destroyed. Although once you were _as numerous as the stars in heaven_, you shall be left few in number, because you did not obey the <sc>Lord</sc> your God. And just as the <sc>Lord</sc> took delight in making you prosperous and numerous, so the <sc>Lord</sc> will take delight in bringing you to ruin and destruction; you shall be plucked off the land that you are entering to possess. The <sc>Lord</sc> will _scatter you among all peoples_, from one end of the earth to the other; and there you shall _serve other gods_, of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known\.\.\.\. The <sc>Lord</sc> will bring you back in ships to Egypt, by a route that I promised you would never see again; and there you shall offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.”

<!--
* The entire story of Israel's exile is summarized here as a revocation of the exodus.
* This is predicated on obedience to "all the words of this law," which is the entirety of the law of Moses.

# The remedy to Israel's disobedience is...
## God's _eternal, unconditional_ covenant with David 
## and his promise to _write the law on the hearts of Israel_.

<!--
* Psalm 89:29–35: “I will establish [David’s] offspring forever and his throne as the days of the heavens. If his children forsake my law… then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes, but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness. I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips. Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.”
* Jer 31:31–34: “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them,” declares the Lord. “This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,” declares the Lord. “I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the Lord. “For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”
